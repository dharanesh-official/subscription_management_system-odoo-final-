## ⚡ Quick Tips for the Jury
*   **Keep it moving:** Don't linger on form filling. Pre-fill data if possible or type fast.
*   **Focus on the "Why":** Don't just say "I click here". Say "I click here *to ensure the customer gets the right invoice*."
*   **Handle Errors Gracefully:** If something loads slow, say "The system checks real-time database constraints."

**Good Luck! 🚀**
